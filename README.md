# Grid-Mapper
Grid Mapper works with WSJT-X to map station grids currently calling CQ and display info for the station currently being worked.

## Releases
Release v1.0 is available with minimal functionality, including calling stations' grids represented on a map, station grid currently being worked showing on a map, and information about station being worked showing up on a side panel. That panel also provides a link to the working station's QRZ page.
Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Cale/Grid-Mapper/releases "releases") page for download options.

## Philosophy
Grid Mapper is designed for the casual FT8 user. It's primary function allows the operator to quickly see where the station being worked is located and easy access to that station's QRZ info. This solved a personal pain point of mine that involved lots of manual typing of callsigns and grid squares into various websites to get the same information. 

## Roadmap
Next steps include:
* OS X release
* Linux ARM release
* Map worked grids from the WSJT-X QSO history log
* Windows installer
