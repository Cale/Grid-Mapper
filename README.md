# Grid-Mapper
Grid Mapper works with WSJT-X. Functionality includes displaying calling stations' grids on a map, displaying previously worked grids on a map, displaying station grid currently being worked on a map, and information about the station being worked showing up on a side panel. That panel also provides a link to the working station's QRZ page.

Color key:
* Green squares: Previously worked station grids.
* Yellow squares: Station grids currently calling CQ.
* Red square: Station currently being worked.
* Blue square: Your QTH.

## Releases
Release v1.1 brings the addition of displaying worked grids on the map. 
Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Cale/Grid-Mapper/releases "releases") page for download options.

## Philosophy
Grid Mapper is designed for the casual FT8 user. It's primary function allows the operator to quickly see where the station being worked is located and easy access to that station's QRZ info. This solved a personal pain point of mine that involved lots of manual typing of callsigns and grid squares into various websites to get the same information. 

## Roadmap
Next steps include:
* OS X release
* Linux ARM release
* ~~Map worked grids from the WSJT-X QSO history log~~
* Windows installer
